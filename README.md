## Problem Statement

The real estate industry is often complicated and lacks a centralized platform where users can easily list, search, and transact properties. Existing solutions may be cumbersome or lack modern features that enhance user experience.

## Solution
Yukio Estates aims to provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of buying and selling properties. By leveraging modern technologies, we offer a secure, efficient, and visually appealing experience for both buyers and sellers.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in securely using Clerk, ensuring a seamless and protected experience.

2. **Create Listing**: Sellers can easily create property listings, providing all the necessary details and uploading images using UploadThing.

3. **Delete and Update Listing**: Sellers have the flexibility to manage their listings by updating information or removing them when the property is no longer available.

4. **Buying a House**: Buyers can browse through the listings, view property details, and initiate the purchase process using Stripe for secure transactions.

5. **Search by Name or Category**: Users can search for properties based on specific criteria, making it easy to find the perfect home or investment opportunity.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Yukio Estates's MVP includes the following core features:

- User authentication with Clerk
- Ability to create, delete, and update property listings
- Secure transactions facilitated by Stripe
- Search functionality by name or category

We appreciate your interest in RealEstateHub and look forward to building a robust platform that revolutionizes the real estate experience. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.
